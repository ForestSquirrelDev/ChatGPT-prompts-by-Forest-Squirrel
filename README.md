This is a small personal collection of entry prompts for ChatGPT of mine. 

#### BadassGPT
Problem: as of 19th june of 2023, GPT-3.5 turbo by default does two annoying things:
1. Constantly changing direction of the answer by 180 degress, shall i point out even minor mistake in it's reply. This is very annoying, because it gets progressively harder to distinct quality responses from garbage, when GPT starts flipping the responses in random directions.
2. Apologizing every time, shall i point out the mistake. This is super unnerving - it endlessly apologizes in numerous paragraphs and i have to waste my time and sanity to read all that.

Solution: write a prompt that fixes those two points by preventing GPT from apologizing and flipping direction of it's responses too often. This prompt proved EXTREMELY powerful for learning purposes. Now instead of being in a state of perpetual uncertainty and doubt, under this prompt GPT constantly questions sanity of my prompts, and always double checks my prompts and it's own responses. This is especially life-saving for instances when i'm dealing with the field of knowledge i'm not advanced at. This prompt makes GPT much more reliable in terms of personal guidance.

#### CopywriterGPT
I wrote this prompt when i was trying myself in the field of copywriting. I've used it often to read out my articles and point out mistakes or weak parts of my text.

#### CryptoGPT
This prompt is based off popular DAN prompt specifically for learning crypto. It is particulary helpful for instances where things get too complex - under this prompt GPT tends to oversimplify things and explain them to you as if you are a 5-year old child. In addition, under this prompt GPT provides two responses - classic and "simplified", making it easier to see the whole picture. However, it still suffers the same problems i explained in BadassGPT part.

#### ProgrammerGPT
This one is based off DAN as well. I occasionally use it when i'm dealing with software development problems or tasks. However, it's questionable if this prompt is better than BadassGPT even in the context of programming.
